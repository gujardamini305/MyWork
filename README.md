<img width="666" height="375" alt="Delivery boy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d83c773-62bd-4630-80c9-c61c74654bfa" />

This project focuses on analyzing Swiggy's sales, user behavior, city-wise performance, and restaurant trends using Power BI. The goal was to extract meaningful business insights to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. The interactive dashboards allow filtering by city, cuisine, gender, age, and more to provide a 360Â° view of performance.



### Data Sources

Mock Swiggy transactional dataset (CSV files)

- Datasets included:

- Order details

- User demographics

- City-wise performance metrics

- Restaurant details and cuisine pricing

- Year-wise and category-wise sales
  

### Tools 
- Power BI Desktop: For data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard creation

- Microsoft Excel: For initial data cleaning and formatting

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For custom calculations and KPIs

### Data Prepration

- Cleaned raw data using Power Query:

 - Removed nulls, handled blanks

 - Standardized column names

 - Created relationships between tables (user, city, orders, ratings)

- Created custom calculated columns for:

 - Average order value by category

 - Total sales by city/year/restaurant

 - Rating metrics and cuisine performance

- Built a proper star schema for optimal performance
